LICENSOR AND THE CHANNEL PARTNER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, OR REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN), WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM(S) OR ANY PART THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE </strong> (whether or not Licensor or the Channel Partner and their respective Affiliates and suppliers knows, has reason to know, has been advised, or is otherwise in fact aware of any such purpose), whether alleged to arise by law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing. <strong> LICENSOR AND THE CHANNEL PARTNER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR APPLICABILITY OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH USE OF THE PROGRAM(S). </strong></p><p> (b) No oral conversations, statements, representations, or other documents, excluding a separately signed agreement between Licensor and Licensee, will be offered by Licensee as evidence to explain, expand, alter, add to or invalidate the above. </p><p> (b) The foregoing indemnity will not apply to any Claim based upon or arising from (i) use of the Program(s) in a manner for which it was not designed or not in accordance with the accompanying documentation, if any, (ii) use of the Program(s), when use of a subsequent software release which Licensor has made available to Licensee would have avoided such infringement; or (iii) Licensee's continued use of the Program(s) subsequent to receipt of notice of any claimed infringement. This Section 7 represents the sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee and the entire liability and obligation of Licensor with respect to infringement or claims of infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property right (including any trade secret) by Licensor or by its operation, use or receipt of the Program(s). </p><p> 8. <strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY</strong></p><p> (a) <strong>SUBJECT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,</strong><strong> LICENSOR, ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS AND THE CHANNEL PARTNER WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. </strong> Regardless of whether or not the parties have been advised of the likelihood of such damages or losses, said limitation of liability includes but is not limited to: lost profits (whether direct or indirect); revenues; anticipated savings; goodwill; business opportunities; wasted or lost production and/or management's or employees' time; loss of or corruption of software data, or database configuration; use of the Program(s) by Licensee; inability of Licensee to use the Program(s); inaccurate output; Licensor's breach of this Agreement; or any other claim arising under or related to this Agreement whether in contract, negligence, tort, or under any other theory of liability. Excluding Licensor's indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 7, in no event will Licensor's and its Affiliates', suppliers', and Channel Partner's aggregate liability to Licensee or any third party exceed, the greater of (a) in the case of a Paid-Up License, the license fee initially paid for such Paid-Up License (not including any TECS fees or other fees) or, in the case of a Lease License, the license fee paid for such Lease License during the preceding twelve (12) months or (b) $5,000 USD. Licensee acknowledges that given all the circumstances, the limits on Licensor's liability are reasonable because of, among other things, the likelihood that without those limitations the amount of damages awardable to Licensee for a breach by Licensor or Channel Partner of this Agreement may be disproportionately greater than the license fees paid or payable for the Program(s). Licensee acknowledges it has taken out adequate insurance to cover its risks under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee is entirely responsible for keeping full back up copies of its software, data and database configurations in accordance with best industry practice. </p><p> (b) Each of Licensor's and its Affiliates', suppliers', and Channel Partner's employees, agents, and sub-contractors may rely upon and enforce the exclusions and restrictions of liability in this Section 8 in that person's own name and for that person's own benefit, as if the words 'and their employees, agents, sub-contractors, and suppliers' followed the words 'Licensor's and its Affiliates', suppliers', and Channel Partner's' wherever it appears in this Section 8. </p><p> (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither party limits its liability (if any) to the other party for any matter which it would be illegal for that party to exclude or to attempt to exclude its liability, but nothing in this clause confers any right or remedy upon the other party to which it would not otherwise be entitled. </p><p> (d) The Program(s) is a mathematical analysis tool intended to assist Licensee in Licensee's development and design processes and requires considerable skill and judgment for its correct use and for the interpretation of the computed results. The Program(s) is not intended to be nor is it a substitute for rigorous and comprehensive prototype or other testing by Licensee of products prior to production and sale. Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Licensor and its Affiliates, suppliers, and Channel Partners, along with its and their officers, directors, employees and agents, (collectively, the 'Indemnified Parties') harmless from and against all losses, damages, liability (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by such Indemnified Parties as a result of Licensee's use of the Program(s), including such losses, damages, and liability resulting from the negligence of the Indemnified Parties; provided, however that such indemnification obligations will not extend to (i) claims for which Licensor is required to indemnify Licensee under Section 7 or (ii) claims arising out of the Indemnified Parties' willful misconduct. </p><p> 9.<strong> TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT (TECS)</strong></p><p> (a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Licensor, TECS is not included with the Program(s). Licensor may provide Customer Support and/or Technical Enhancements at its sole discretion and may require Licensee to pay an additional fee. Only in the event that Licensor indicates in writing to Licensee that Licensor will provide TECS will the provisions of Section 9(b) and 9(c) apply. </p><p> (b) TECS will consist of (i) reasonable web page, forum, telephone or email support ('Customer Support'); and/or (ii) Program releases or corrections provided by Licensor without additional charge to Program licensees generally ('Technical Enhancements'). Customer Support will be provided by Licensor or its designee in Licensor's discretion. Technical Enhancements will be provided by Licensor at its discretion and at such times as determined solely by Licensor. </p><p> (c) During the period of time during which Licensee is entitled to receive TECS for a Program, Licensee may request three (3) replacement License Keys due to a change of the Designated Network within one year from the TECS effective date at no additional charge. </p><p> 10. <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p><p> (a) All notices required in this Agreement will be given in writing to all parties and delivered by registered air mail, international air courier, facsimile, or mutually agreed equivalent. Notices will be effective when received as indicated on the facsimile, registered mail or other mutually agreeable delivery receipt. All notices will be given by one party to the other using the contact information indicated on the License Form or Service Agreement, unless a change thereof previously has been given in writing to the party giving the notice. </p><p> (b) Licensee will not assign this Agreement or individual Program(s) license to any third party by operation of law, or in bankruptcy, or otherwise without prior written consent of Licensor. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns and permitted transferees. </p><p> (c) The provisions of Sections 2(e), 3(d), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 will survive termination of this Agreement or any individual Program(s) license. </p><p> (d) The rights and obligations of the parties hereto will be governed by the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, excluding the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods and choice of law provisions. </p><p> (e) The parties hereto consent to the venue and jurisdiction of the federal and state courts maintaining jurisdiction over Washington County, Pennsylvania for purposes of any legal proceedings arising under or relating to this Agreement. </p><p> (f) If any provision of this Agreement will be invalid, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. </p><p> (g) Any failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of such right of the party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. </p><p> (h) The benefits and burdens of, and risk of loss and damage to, Licensee's copy of the Program(s) will remain with Licensor until the Program(s) is received (physically or electronically) by Licensee. </p><p> (i) This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties and supersedes all proposals, oral or written, and all other communications between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as specifically provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a written amendment executed by duly authorized officers or representatives of the parties. No purchase order or any other standardized business forms issued by Licensee, and even if such purchase order or other standardized business forms provides that it takes precedence over any other agreement between the parties, shall be effective to contradict, modify, or delete from the terms of this Agreement in any manner whatsoever. Any acknowledgment, written or oral, of any such purchase order or standardized business form is not recognized as a subsequent writing and will not act as acceptance of such terms. </p><p> (j) ANY OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTED IS DISTRIBUTED SOLELY IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE USEFUL BUT IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT ANY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTY; INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
