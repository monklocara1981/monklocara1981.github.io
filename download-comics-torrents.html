A VPN can help mask your identity, location and more. NordVPN (ref link with coupon) is solid. Your privacy is important. Save yourself the headache of potentially dealing with legal repercussions later on down the road.</p><p>Hp utility download <a href='https://Hp-Utility-Download-Mac-Os.peatix.com/'>mac</a> os. They have a couple of different options if you are interested:</p><h3>Special 2y offer extra75</h3><div class='JFH'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vl_bYgTAaeU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h3>Last chance to grab 3-year NordVPN </h3><p>Without Library Genesis I’m not sure I would have made it through university. Thank you to Reddit for showing me the light. </p><p>Library Genesis pretty much has every single book known to man and it provides it all to you at your fingertips.</p><p>At first, it’s easy to be apprehensive about using library genesis because it looks like something you probably should not trust.</p><h2>How to get free college textbooks</h2><p>I first started using Library Genesis in College to get textbooks I would barely ever use. Textbooks were expensive and I could not justify the hassle of paying for them at the time when I knew every read I could possibly imagine was on the internet. </p><p>They may not have the most recent version of your college textbook but it should be able to get the job done for you.</p><p>Library Genesis can be a bit weird when it comes to downloading actual torrents. They don’t always have enough peers but it does seem that the direct downloads almost always work. Make sure you have proper security measures set up on your computer before downloading just in case. I have been using it for almost 5 years without any issues. </p><p>Library Genesis is great for finding an obscure pdf of your college textbook or other books most large torrent sites do not have. </p><p>I find that I end up just checking Library Genesis before any other source.</p><p>Once you find your books make sure you use something like Calibre, an open source project to manage your ebook library. It has options to help you go mobile like Calibre Companion.</p><p>Zlibrary is very similar to library Genesis with a much nicer user interface. </p><p>Quick heal total security 2014 serial key expires <a href='/quick-heal-total-security-2014-serial-key-expires-2018.html' title='2018'>2018</a>. The site works extremely well and can provide you with all of your book downloading needs. the only difference here is that you need to make an account.</p><p> They allow you to download up to 10 books daily with a free account and are supported off of a donation system to raise your downloading limits. It’s a worthy cause to support in my opinion.</p><p>The only real downside is that they don’t have torrents and it’s only direct downloads. This actually makes the process much smoother and you end up happy as can be. </p><p>Pirate Bay was my first love and will always have a place in my heart. It all started back when I was 14 I became a hardened internet criminal pirating movies just because I could. The Pirate Bay was and still is the place to be when it comes to finding books and other types of torrents online. </p><p>You can easily search any title on there and you will be able to find almost any type of file you can possibly imagine. </p><p>There are so many people on Pirate Bay that the Top 100 ebooks page is basically a “best seller”/”Best stolen” list.</p><p>If you are looking for Manga, Comics or Graphic novels there are numerous top 100 pages for you to also browse through.</p><p>This is always a great choice when looking for popular ebooks. Having the ability to use a magnet link helps keep you safer as someone who is downloading a lot of links so make sure to use this benefit when using The Pirate Bay.</p><p>The rest of the list is where I enter the territory of “maybe I’ll just buy the book or maybe I won’t read it because no one cares about it enough to torrent it”.</p><p>The Image at the top of this post was the homepage of the Pirate Bay when the domain registrars were trying to take them down. This was a very cool response by them.</p><p>Kickass Torrents is a great backup to The Pirate Bay when looking for a book. Most of the time they will just have the same options but sometimes you can get lucky and find exactly what you are looking for that you could not find anywhere else.</p><h3 id='where-can-i-download-comics-torrents'>Where Can I Download Comics Torrents</h3><p>They have gone downhill quite a bit probably from getting shut down and other random things.</p><p>Make sure to use magnet links to help protect yourself when using Kickass and always read the ratings. This goes without saying for any Torrent site honestly. If there aren’t numerous people thanking the uploader in the comments it can seem a bit fishy. But sometimes this social proof can be manufactured so be careful. It just comes with the territory of downloading things you probably shouldn’t be on the internet.</p><p><strong>Torrentz</strong></p><p>Torrentz is the main Torrentz search engine that I use when looking for books when I’m willing to hunt a file a down. </p><p>This is truly your last resort. If you can’t find it here you should probably just stop and do a direct download from Library Genesis.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>I’m sure you can guess what I am going to tell you next. Yes, use Library Genesis, Zlibrary, The Pirate Bay, Kickass then give up in that order. </p><p>If you are looking for something more specific for instance reading comics online. We went through all the best ways to read those too!</p><p>All opinions are my own and do not reflect the views of Calibre Companion.</p><img src='https://i.imgur.com/mSRbuNw.jpg' alt='Download comics torrents' title='Download comics torrents'><p>Don’t forget to get the preliminary downloads before starting!</p><p>Do you want to make money writing articles like this one for the blog?
