Don’t worry, the two terms, instructions and symbols, are readily interchangeable.</em></p><p>Grab a Normally Open contact symbol (or instruction) from the Instruction Tool bar and drag and drop it into the start of the first rung….</p><p>If we drop the instruction in the wrong spot or have accidentally dropped the wrong instruction then we can cancel it by hitting the ESC key.</p><p>If we have already declared the symbol and want to delete it then select the symbol and hit the Delete key.</p><p>A dialogue box will popup so we can declare the symbol.</p><h4><strong>PLC Simulator Input Symbol Declaration</strong></h4><p>The Do-more PLC programming simulator allocates symbol addressing the same as the actual real life PLC.</p><p>In this example we will be declaring digital inputs and digital outputs as per below….</p><p>X0-2047 (Digital Inputs)</p><p>Y0-2047 (Digital Outputs)</p><p>Because this PLC simulator is fully featured there are other symbol declarations possible, but we will not be using them for this example….</p><p>C0-2047 (Digital Internal Variables)</p><p>RX0-255 (Real Analog Inputs)</p><p>WX0-255 (Signed Word Analog Inputs )</p><p>RY0-255 (Real Analog Outputs )</p><p>WY0-255 (Signed Word Analog Outputs</p><p>R0-2047 (Real Internal Analog Variables)</p><p>V0-2047 (Unsigned Word Internal Analog Variables)</p><p>N0-2047 (Signed Word Internal Analog Variables )</p><p>D0-2047 (Signed Double Word Internal Analog Variables)</p><p>T0-255 (Timers )</p><p>CT0-255 (Counters)</p><p>ST0-1023 (System Variables)</p><p>To declare the instruction as a digital input type X0 into the text field and click on the magnifying glass icon. Don’t worry about the yellow popup box for now, you can close it if you want….</p><p>After the magnifying glass icon is selected the Element Browser table will popup. Fill it in as per below….</p><p>And then click Select.…</p><p>Save the changes when prompted.</p><p>Then click on the tick icon to accept the instruction declaration…</p><p>Now, the first rung of the ladder diagram should have the normally open contact with all the declared information displayed above it, as per below….</p><h4><strong>PLC Simulator Output Symbol Declaration</strong></h4><p>So let’s add an output to the first rung.</p><p>Double click on the NOP output on the right hand side of the first rung. The instruction declaration pop up box appears.</p><p>This time we need to declare an output address, so type Y0 into the text field. Then click the magnifying glass….</p><p>After the magnifying glass icon is selected the Element Browser table will popup. Fill it in as per below….</p><p>And then click Select.…</p><p>Save the changes when prompted.</p><p>Then click on the tick icon to accept the instruction declaration…</p><p>The first rung of the ladder diagram should now have the normally open contact in series with the output. All the declaration information should be displayed above each ladder logic symbol….</p><h4><strong>Adding More Symbols Using the Ladder Diagram Editor</strong></h4><p>Let’s continue with adding the rest of the ladder diagram symbols for the Latching logic.</p><p>This time we need to drag and drop a normally closed contact into the position next to INPUT A.</p><p>Use the same procedure as above to declare the instruction. This time declare it as input X1 as per the information below…</p><p>Remember to click Select, Save the changes if prompted and then click on the tick icon to accept the instruction declaration.</p><p>Now we’re cooking. The Main program should look like this….</p><h4><strong>Adding a Symbol Branch Using the Ladder Diagram Editor</strong></h4><p>Time to add the last ladder diagram symbol to complete our ladder logic latch PLC simulator example.</p><p>Grab a normally open contact and drag and drop it into the area just below the INPUT A symbol.</p><p>This symbol has already been declare so we do not need to declare it again. Just enter Y0 in the instruction declaration text box and hit the tick icon or press enter.</p><p>The Main program should look like this….</p><p>Notice there is a connection missing between the new symbol just added and rung 1.</p><p>We can add that connection by clicking on INPUT B symbol to select it. Then going to the main toolbar and selecting Edit, Wire and the Down.</p><p>This will create a connection from rung 1 down to the end of Output Y normally open contact. Thus creating a branch (or parallel) connection across INPUT A normally open contact….</p><p>The final result should look like this….</p><h3><strong>Compile the </strong><strong>Changes Made to the </strong><strong>Ladder Diagram </strong></h3><p>Before we can proceed we need to compile any changes that have been made to the ladder diagram.</p><p>The yellow bar on the left hand side of the first rung on the ladder diagram prompts you to compile the programming changes by clicking the Accept button in the Main Toolbar….</p><p>After the Accept button is clicked a green bar appears prompting you to save the ladder diagram project.</p><p>Click the Save button in the Main Toolbar and if the properties pop up box appears click ok. Once the project is saved the green bar disappears….</p><h3><strong>Connect to the PLC Simulator</strong></h3><p>We are now ready to connect to the PLC programming simulator.</p><p>The PLC programming simulator behaves just like a PLC. You need to connect to it, download your program and place it in RUN mode.</p><p>First we need to fire up the PLC simulator by clicking on the Do-more/Sim button on the Main Toolbar….</p><p>Click OK when the “Launch and Connect to Do-more PLC Simulator?” pop up appears. The Do-more PLC Simulator will then launch….</p><p>You may have some communication errors pop up. This is because we haven’t connected to the PLC simulator yet.</p><p>Please Note….The error popup box may be behind the PLC simulator window. This took a bit to figure out, very sneaky. Hope that saves you some pain!</p><p>If you get an error pop up box appear displaying “Comm Link not responding” then click Cancel….</p><img src='https://www.eglobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/57-20.jpg' alt='Logic' title='Logic'><p>If you get an error pop up box appear “Unable to establish a link to the PLC.” then click OK….</p><p>Now, let’s connect to the PLC simulator. Go to the PLC tab in the Main Toolbar and click on Connect….</p><p>The “Select Link…” pop up box appears with “MySim: on Local Port” highlighted. Make sure to select the “Link Enabled” check box in the bottom left hand corner and then click the Select button….</p><p>The “Resolve Online/Offline Differences” pop up box appears because we have not downloaded the ladder diagram to the PLC simulator yet. Click on “Go Online and view the DISK project” button….</p><p>Then click the Continue Online button when the “Online/Offline Incompatibility” pop up box appears….</p><p>Click the Next button when the “Set PLC Clock” pop up box appears….</p><p>Click the Finish button when the “Setup System Configuration” pop up box appears….</p><p>We should now be connected to the PLC simulator. The Status Bar at the bottom of the ladder diagram editor should read Online….</p><p>Also, the PLC simulator EthRX and EthTX indication boxes should be green to indicate simulated Ethernet transmit and receive signals between the software and PLC simulator.</p><p>If they are flashing then the Status function is turned off, we’ll take care of that a bit later….</p><h3><strong>Download and Run the PLC Simulator</strong></h3><h2 id='ladder-logic-program-for-mac-pdf'>Ladder Logic Program For Mac Pdf</h2><p>The light blue bar on the left hand side of the first rung on the ladder diagram indicate that there are differences between the offline ladder diagram and online PLC programming simulator.</p><p>Also, the S, P and D boxes in the bottom Status Bar are also highlighted light blue to indicate that there are program differences between the offline ladder diagram and online PLC programming simulator.</p><p>Lastly, there should be warning message appear just below the rung editing area which is triggered because of the differences between the offline ladder diagram and online PLC simulator ….</p><p>All we need to do to now is download the offline ladder diagram to the PLC programming simulator.</p><p>Click on “Write PLC” in Main Toolbar to download the ladder diagram to the PLC simulator….</p><p>When the “Download Project to PLC” pop up box appears select the check box to “Switch to RUN mode after download completes” and then click OK….</p><p>Click Yes to turn ALL STATUS ON….</p><p>Now we are connected to the PLC programming simulator, have downloaded the ladder diagram and have turned the Status indication ON.</p><p>We should have the status bar at the bottom of the ladder diagram editor window displaying Online and Run….</p><p>The PLC simulator EthRX and EthTX indication boxes should change to be steady green when the Status indication ON.</p><p>We have already put the PLC simulator into RUN mode when we did the download, but while we are here we can drag and drop the PLC Mode Switch from TERM to RUN….</p><p>Now we’re ready to put the PLC simulator through its paces!</p><h3><strong>Using the PLC Simulator</strong></h3><p>To use the PLC Simulator we just need to click on the input address buttons X0-X15 to change the state of the inputs. When the button is the depressed position the input is ON and when the button is in the released position the input is OFF.</p><p>In the ladder diagram the status of the logic symbols highlights in light blue when the ladder symbol logic flow is TRUE.</p><p>If the ladder diagram symbols are not highlighting then click on “Status” in Main Toolbar to enable it….</p><p>When Inputs X0 and X1 are both de-activated then the logic flow is blocked and Output Y0 is OFF….</p><p>To activate and de-activate inputs we simply click on the X0-15 buttons in the PLC simulator. One click turns the input ON another click turns it OFF….</p><p>To SET the latch we must activate Input X0 and de-activated Input X1.</p><p>So, Click on the X0 button in the PLC simulator to activate Input X0. Input X1 is already de-activated so we don’t need do anything with it at this stage….</p><p>Notice that logic flows through X0 and X1 to output Y0 and they are all highlighted….</p><p>Once the latch is SET we can de-activate Input X0 by clicking on the X0 button in the PLC simulator. Notice that Output Y0 is ON and is held in….</p><p>To RESET the latch activate Input X1 by clicking on the X1 button in the PLC simulator.</p><p>Because Input X1 is assigned to a normally closed contact symbol logic flow is blocked when the input is activated. That’s opposite to how a normally open contact symbol works and it’s called reverse logic….</p><p>To once again SET the latch from this point, Input X1 must be de-activated and then input X0 can be activated.</p><h3><strong>Adding a Rung Comment Using the Ladder Diagram Editor</strong></h3><h2 id='ladder-logic-program-for-mac-os'>Ladder Logic Program For Mac Os</h2><p>To really start program like a pro let’s add a comment to the rung.

Over time they have advanced to become more user friendly, efficient, smaller and less expensive. Different types of programming languages have also been developed for PLCs but the most frequently used is still Ladder Logic.</p><h2 id='ladder-logic-program-for-mac-download'>Ladder Logic Program For Mac Download</h2><h2><strong>The Origins of Ladder Logic – Relay Logic</strong></h2><p>Imagine for a second it’s 1980. You’re cruising in your brand new Ford Pinto on the way to your job at the local Rubik’s Cube plant. You have a busy day ahead since the plant is being redesigned for the new Rubik’s Revenge model due out next year. The relay panels you work on need to be rewired to accommodate the change in production size, from the original 3x3x3 size to the new 4x4x4 model.</p><p>These relay panels consist of numerous electromechanical relays that are wired together to perform a certain function in the plant. The simple opening and closing of relay contacts on the panel gives the system the ON/OFF control it needs in the manufacturing process. For instance, when the cube’s mold is in position a switch will close. This switch energizes a relay coil, which in turn closes the normally open contact for the injection pump. The pump fills the mold with melted plastic and the cube begins to take shape.</p><p>Using this combination of switches, relays, coils and contacts is referred to as Relay Logic. Relay logic is a dependable controls method still in limited use today. But the cost associated with it in terms of time-consuming logic changes, mechanical failures over time and extensive wiring and space requirements has forced many industries to reconsider their control needs. What they discovered was the PLC.</p><h2><strong>The Structure of Ladder Logic/How to Read Ladder Logic</strong></h2><p>The structure behind ladder logic is based on the electrical ladder diagrams that were used with relay logic. These diagrams documented how connections between devices were made on relay panels; they are called “ladder” diagrams because they are constructed in a way that resembles a ladder with two vertical rails and rungs between them. The positive power rail (on the left) flows to the negative power rail (on the right) through the physical devices connected on the rung. The example below shows a ladder diagram with pushbuttons (PB), control relays (CR), a motor (M) and a light (L).</p><h2><strong>Similarities with Ladder Diagrams<br></strong></h2><p>Ladder logic was designed to have the same look and feel as electrical ladder diagrams, but with ladder logic, the physical contacts and coils are replaced with memory bits. Let’s take a look.</p><p>For this program, the relay logic’s ladder diagram is duplicated with ladder logic; no more hard-wired logic, but memory locations instead. Some of these memory locations are used internally and others are used with external inputs and outputs. To monitor and control real world devices, they will need to be wired to I/O modules.</p><p>For this particular PLC, these inputs and outputs are assigned to X and Y memory addresses like the X001 seen with PB1. This normally open contact’s state is read from the input on the I/O module where the physical pushbutton is connected. On the other hand, each Y bit will have an output device wired to it as seen with the light controlled by Y001. All of the other locations are assigned to internal bits that we can use as needed.</p><p>One side note, today’s PLC CPUs offer many types of functions, not just simple contacts and coils. Math, Shift Registers, Drum Sequencers, etc., are available to aid in programming.</p><h2><strong>Execution of Ladder Logic</strong></h2><p>Typically before starting to execute the logic, the CPU reads the physical inputs tied to the I/O modules to update their status in the CPU’s memory table. Then, starting at the top left of the program, the CPU works its way down the rail executing each rung or sub rung from left to right. So if PB1 is pressed, the CPU will turn ON CR1. Since CR1 has changed states, in rung 3 the CPU will activate CR3. CR3’s normally-closed state is used in rung 4, so the CPU will then turn OFF L1.</p><p>Even though we still refer to coils and contacts in ladder logic, remember that they are memory representations, not actual devices. Once the CPU reaches the last rung it will update the real world outputs, then loop back and run it all again. This process will continue as long as the CPU is powered and in the RUN mode.</p><p>The time it takes the CPU to execute one pass and loop back to the beginning is known as scan time. Scan time can be important to applications where timing is critical. Subroutines and special purpose I/O modules can be used to help reduce the scan time if needed.</p><h2><strong>The Logic Behind The Ladder</strong></h2><p>So what logic can ladder logic actually perform? With the increasing demand for functionality and ease of use, many of today’s PLCs incorporate function blocks with ladder logic. The structure of the program is still ladder with the more complex instructions being function blocks. So to answer the question, let’s look at a few examples:</p><p>[list style=”arrow” color=”blue”]</p><ul><li><strong>1. Boolean Logic:</strong> The ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE algebra of binary systems, the basics of which are AND, OR and NOT operators. To put it simply, rung 5 in our code needs CR1(C1) AND CR2(C2) to turn ON motor M1 (Y002).</li><li><strong>2. Timing:</strong> Timer instructions are available to allow for on-delayed or off-delayed events. Once triggered, the timer will turn its associated output ON (on-delay) or OFF (off-delay) after the set time has elapsed.</li><li><strong>3. Counting:</strong> Count-up and count-down functions increase or decrease the counter value on every transition of the input.</li><li><strong>4. Comparisons:</strong> Compare instructions are available to determine if values are less than, equal to or greater than each other.</li><li><strong>5. Math:</strong> These instructions not only allow for the simple addition and subtraction but also for more complex operations like tangents, square roots, etc.</li><li><strong>6. Special functions:</strong> These include PID loops, communication instructions, shift registers, drum sequencers, ramp generators, etc.</li></ul><h2 id='ladder-logic-program-for-mac-free'>Ladder Logic Program For Mac Free</h2><p>[/list]</p><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HTnmSJxHfUQ/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Ladder Logic Program For Mac' title='Ladder Logic Program For Mac'><h2><strong>Try an Exercise</strong></h2><p>If you would like to try an exercise in ladder logic, AutomationDirect has created a beginner’s programming exercise.
