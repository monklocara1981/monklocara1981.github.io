Plant Layout Design Software InData v.2.0.2 InData-a plug-in for Adobe InDesign-brings the full layout, design, typographic and picture publishing power of Adobe InDesign to bear on all your data-driven repetitive publishing tasks.</p><p>If landscape design has to be done manually every time, the world would be filled with plain-looking yards. Gorgeous lawns would be a rare sight to see. Can you imagine having to create a diorama of a garden with miniature ponds, trees, and plants or worse, actually constructing fences, plots, and sheds just to see how they would look in your outdoor space? Don’t bother. This is why in this field, planning is of utmost importance. And on that note, landscape design software is your best friend.</p><p>In this article, we have compiled 12 of the best free landscape design software we could find on the market to cut time off your search for one. They’re different types of free: completely free, a free version with pro upgrades, free trial, and separate tool from the main premium product and thus is free. Whether you’re a homeowner, professional, hobbyist, or a business looking for a decent way to test the waters before possibly committing to a purchase, the ones on this list allow you to do just that.</p><div><h4>What are the 12 best free landscape design software solutions?</h4></div><p>Landscaping isn’t new. It is, in fact, an art that dates way back in human history, although it’s worth noting that the term landscape architecture wasn’t used until the 18th century. In the Roman Era, houses of notably rich and powerful families have manicured gardens and lawns and Japanese estates have their famous Zen garden. During the Renaissance period, the scope of art has extended beyond painting and literature. It also spread into the field of architecture, extending into lawns and gardens. Thus, landscaping as we know it was born. This practice had endured until the very day.</p><p>But unlike before, landscaping can be observed in most houses today and not just in luxurious celebrity homes either. In fact, it is a lot more common for modern households to have landscaped yards instead of plain ones. One reason for that is how beneficial this practice is. Landscaping has many ways of improving the overall appearance of a place. And in practical terms, homes with good landscape design enjoy a 5.5% to 12.7% higher selling rate than otherwise. If the property costs $300,000, this means that homeowners would be able to enjoy a bump of up to $38,100 in value.</p><p>There are other practical benefits to doing landscaping as well. For example, having plenty of trees, plants, and other vegetation in your home can help control flooding. On top of that, you can have plants surrounding you that release oxygen and curbs greenhouse gases. To enjoy these benefits and more, you need a proper landscape design, which you can achieve with the right software.</p><h2>12 Best Free Landscape Design Software</h2><h3>1.
