Trying six quick checks and fixes</li><li>2. Checking if Finder allows connected external hard drive showing up</li><li>3. Updating related WD Apps with WD Discovery for Mac</li><li>4. Checking if the WD hard drive is password locked</li><li>5. Repairing the unrecognized WD hard drive with First Aid</li><li>6. Use WD Drive Utilities to check the unrecognized WD hard drives</li><li>7. Reformatting the WD hard drives when it's not working</li></ul><h2>First, See How Mac Recognizes a WD External Hard Drive</h2><p>The process of Mac recognizing an external hard drive is a little complicated even though you can't see it. Specifically, when you plug a WD hard drive into a Mac computer, macOS would be notified. Then macOS will call all related hardware and software to read, recognize, and show this hard drive on the Desktop and in Finder, so that finally you can access your data on the drive on your Mac computer.</p><p>So, we usually simplify this process in 4 steps:</p><ol><li>The WD hard drive is supplied with power, so that Mac can detect this storage device.</li><li>macOS reads partition information of the WD hard drive.</li><li>macOS recognizes the file system of each volume.</li><li>Users access data on the WD hard drive.</li></ol><p>However, if any part of this process goes wrong, hard drive problems like Mac won't recognize your WD hard drive would occur. As a consequence, you can't access, copy, write to or transfer data stored on it.</p><h2>Now, Fix WD hard drive not recognized issue on Mac</h2><p>So, based on the process of Mac recognizing a WD hard drive, we need a thorough check to know which part makes the WD hard drive not working on Mac, and then fix it.</p><h3>1. Try Quick fixes when WD hard drive is not recognized by Mac</h3><p>A proper connection is the most basic condition that Mac can access the WD hard drive. Or else the external hard drive would not even show up in Disk Utility. When your Mac can't recognize an external hard drive, you can always do the following quick fixes at the very beginning. </p><ul><li> Make sure the WD hard drive is externally plugged into a wall outlet if it's a WD desktop hard drive like WD Elements Desktop and My Cloud.</li><li> Connect the WD hard drive directly to the computer and do not use a USB Hub.</li><li> Try a different USB cable and port for power and data supply, especially if the My Passport external hard drive is not showing up in Disk Utility.</li><li> Try a different USB-C adapter to connect the WD hard drive if your Mac only has the Thunderbolt 3 port.</li><li> Try to connect the WD hard drive with a different Mac computer to check if the WD hard drive can be recognized on that Mac.</li><li> Try to plug the WD hard drive in to a Windows PC to check if the file system of the WD hard drive is not compatible with Mac.</li></ul><p>The WD hard drive lights on but is not recognized by Mac still? </p><p>Wait! Do you allow your Mac to show the recognized WD hard drive in the Finder and Desktop?</p><h3>2. Show the WD hard drive in the Finder and Desktop</h3><p>Sometimes, you think WD hard drive is not recognized by Mac because the WD external hard drive isn't showing up on Mac, neither in Finder nor on the desktop. However, the fact is that the WD hard drive is detected by macOS but it is not set to show up on Mac.</p><p>In this case, you can show the WD hard drive by changing the preferences: </p><ul><li>Step 1: Go to Finder &gt; Preferences &gt; General, make sure the 'External disks' option is ticked. This will make the recognized WD hard drive show up on the Desktop.</li><li>Step 2: Select Sidebar tab on the top, make sure the 'External disks' option under Locations is also ticked.</li></ul><p>The WD hard drive is not working on Mac still?</p><p>Well, it seems that Mac really can't recognize the WD hard drive. We need to take advantage of some tools for further check. </p><h3>3. Update incompatible WD Apps with WD Discovery for Mac</h3><p>WD Discovery is a desktop software for Mac and Windows for delivering WD software, updates and notifications for WD external hard drives. </p><p>When WD hard drive is not recognized, you can download WD Discovery for Mac to update WD Drive Utilities, WD Security, WD Backup, etc. Possibly, your Mac doesn't recognize the WD hard drive because the WD software is not compatible with your macOS.</p><h3>4. Check if the WD hard drive is password locked</h3><p>If you are using WD hard drives like My Book Drive and it is not recognized by Mac now, you can check if the hard drive is password protected. macOS can't read the partition information and mount the volumes if the WD hard drive is password locked. You can download and install WD Security to unlock the WD hard drive if a password has been set to protect the hard drive.</p><p>The WD hard drive is not encrypted? Then the reason for Mac not recognizing the WD hard drive is that macOS fails to access the partition and file system information. It could be a problem when WD external hard drive used on PS4 extended drive but not recognized.</p><h3>5. Repair the unrecognized WD hard drive in Disk Utility</h3><p>Disk Utility is a built-in disk management and repair tool on Mac computers. When a WD hard drive is not recognized or not working due to inner disk errors, you can try to repair the unrecognizable WD hard drive with Disk Utility.</p><p><span>Note:</span> If the WD hard drive is recognzied in in Disk Utility but not mounted, you can select the Mount option first then the WD hard drive will be mounted on the Desktop.</p><ul><li>Step 1: Go to Applications &gt; Disk Utility.</li><li>Step 2: Click 'View' and choose 'Show All Devices'. </li><li>Step 3: Select the unrecognized WD hard drive from the sidebar. </li><li>Step 4: Click on First Aid on the top. Wait while First Aid verifying and fixing possible errors of the WD hard drive.</li></ul><p>If First Aid can't repair the external hard drive, or Disk Utility doesn't recognize the volumes of the drive, probably, the WD hard drive could be corrupted caused by bad sectors.</p><h3>6. Use WD Drive Utilities when WD hard drives not working on Mac</h3><p>WD Drive Utilities for Mac is a specialized utility for WD hard drives to run drive diagnostics (fix potential drive failures, slow disk performance, and bad sectors), Manage RAID configuration (For RAID supported models), Erase and format WD hard drives, etc.</p><img src='https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/43/41/65/43416536-be01-c744-091c-8c1fbacc8c21/pr_source.jpg/576x768bb.jpg' alt='Purple Restore Download For Mac' title='Purple Restore Download For Mac'><p>If a WD hard drive won't work normally on a Mac due to bad sectors or other parameter errors, you can download WD Drive Utilities for Mac to have a diagnosis of what happens to your hard drive.</p><ul><li>Step 1: Install WD Drive Utilities on your Mac and then launch it.</li><li>Step 2: Plug the unrecognizable WD hard drive into the Mac.</li><li>Step 3: Click on 'Diagnose' and choose 'Run Quick Drive Test' to check the WD drive completely.</li></ul><h3>7.
