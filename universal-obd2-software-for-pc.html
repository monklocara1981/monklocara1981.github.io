As such, iOS devices can not connect to ELM327 modules with Bluetooth – you must use WiFi with your device*.</p><p>AutoProPlus<br>AutoProPlus is a free app for monitoring your vehicle with an iPhone.

The free version is time-limited, so if you find it useful, you will want to upgrade to the pro version.</p><p>ScanMaster for ELM327<br>A great free app from WGSoft.de, makers of the other ScanMaster programs. Should be one of the first apps that you try.

We are often asked about pairing codes and while we can never know exactly what code would apply to your interface, we can say that most use either 0000 or 1234.</p>top<br><h3>Other Software</h3><p>Some items that don’t fit into the above categories:</p><p>Electric Vehicle Wiki<br>Interest in electric vehicles continues to grow. If your interest is with them, you may find this Wiki helpful.</p><p>Engine Link<br>Use ELM327 Bluetooth adapters with your Windows Phone.</p><p>Nokia N800 and Carman<br>If anyone is still using a Nokia N800 internet tablet, they may wish to have a look at the Carman software.

There are a number of solutions for this. The following lists only a few:</p><p>HW VSP3 – Virtual Serial Port<br>This software adds a COM port to your computer that connects to a virtual serial port over a TCP/IP network (typically ethernet or WiFi).
